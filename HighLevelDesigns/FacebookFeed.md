# Facebook News Feed System Design

## 1. Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- Users should see posts from friends and followed pages
- Users can create, delete, and edit posts
- Posts can contain text, images, videos
- Users can like and comment on posts
- Feed should be personalized
- Posts should appear in real-time

### Non-Functional Requirements
- High availability
- Low latency (< 2s feed load time)
- Consistency can be eventual
- System should be scalable

## 2. Scale Estimation
- 2 billion active users
- 500 million daily posts
- Average post size: 1 MB
- Read to write ratio: 100:1

## 3. System Design

### High-Level Components
1. Web Servers
2. Application Servers
3. Cache Layer
4. Database Layer
5. Message Queue
6. Feed Generation Service
7. Notification Service

### Data Model
```sql
Users (id, name, email, ...)
Posts (id, user_id, content, timestamp, ...)
Relationships (user_id, friend_id, type, ...)
Interactions (user_id, post_id, type, timestamp)
```

## 4. Feed Generation
- Pull-based (on-demand)
- Push-based (fan-out)
- Hybrid approach for optimal performance

## 5. Optimization Techniques
- Content CDN
- Redis caching
- News Feed pre-computing
- Intelligent batch processing

## 6. Additional Considerations
- Load balancing
- Data partitioning
- Fault tolerance
- Monitoring and analytics
